# snakecase 0.4.0

* CRAN submission

# snakecase 0.3.5.3

* changed order of the customizing arguments of `to_any_case()`

# snakecase 0.3.5.2

* fixed bug for combination of protect and postprocess. Therefore clarified and rewrote the internal order of `to_any_case()`
* resolved all internal build warnings and notes

# snakecase 0.3.5.1

* fixed bug in replace_special_characters combined with screaming snake case.

# snakecase 0.3.5

* any local special characters are now supported.
* added 2 arguments to `to_any_case()`: empty_fill, which allows to fill strings
matching to "" with the supplied string. unique_sep adds an integer suffix separated
with the supplied string, when not `NULL`.
* fixed a bug in to_snake_case_internal(). groups of digits are not separated in
between anymore.
* digits that are not direct next to each other, will be split via "_" in both camel case
versions. This is a meaningful exception. Otherwise information would be lost and
also the consistency rules in the readme wouldn't hold in this case.

# snakecase 0.3.4

* any_case() is now vectorised over pre-/postprocess, pre-/postfix for all case arguments
* introduces protect as (vectorised) argument to to_any_case(). it accepts regular expressions and cleans "_" or whatever the preprocessing did, between matches.
* some more tests, documentation and fixes.

# snakecase 0.3.3

* introduced case = "parsed" in to_any_case()
* introduced to_parsed_case()

# snakecase 0.3.2

* finished vignette (title: Caseconverters) and replaced the usage part in readme with it.
* changed behaviour in snake_case_internal to always treat whitespaces as underscores.
for whitespaces in output postprocess = " " is recommended.

# snakecase 0.3.1

* started testing `to_any_case` and removed a bug.
* added vignette

# snakecase 0.3.0

* supports behaviour for german umlauts on all platforms
* intoduced internal function `to_snake_case_internal()` which does the preprocessing and simplifies all other functions (especially `to_any_case()`) a little bit.
* introduced `to_screaming_snake_case()`
* added arguments prefix, postfix and replace_special_characters to `to_any_case()`.
* completely renewed readme
* updated tests and highly modularized all tests. (just to_any_case lacks some tests now and in general more examples testcases have to be written)

# snakecase 0.2.2

* introduced `to_any_case()` (all functionality and documentation provided, but implementation has to be cleaned and also tests have to be written)

# snakecase 0.2.1

* fixed bug: `to_snake_case_dev(c("ssRRss"))` returns now `ss_r_rss` instead of`"ss_r_r_ss"`
* `to_snake_case()` now treats only spaces like underscores now (not dots anymore)
* functionality to treat different stuff like dots will be added via a new function:  
`to_any_case()`, which will wrap the other three and will have pre- and postprocess arguments

# snakecase 0.2.0

* renamed the single input parameters consistent to `string` (without deprecating
the old name before, since the package was in early dev-stage anyway).
* started a to develop and implement consistent logic (which still has to be better documented in the readme)
* introduced tests for more hard coded examples and the logic behind it (still more
hardcoded examples and a third part of the logic have to be tested)
* internal logic has been simplified and modularised a lot, which makes it easier
to maintain and introduce more highlevel features in the future
* added integrated tests via appveyor on windows
* added badges for cran status and codecoverage to readme

# snakecase 0.1.0

* Introduced `to_snake_case()` which converts strings to snake_case.
* added functions `to_small_camel_case()` and `to_big_camel_case()` which internally
build up on `to_snake_case()` and convert to the appropriate target case.
* added basic hard coded tests
* added integrated tests on linux via travis.ci
