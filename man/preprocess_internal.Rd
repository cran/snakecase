\item{string}{A string.}

\item{sep_in}{(short for separator input) A regex supplied as a character (if not \code{NULL}), which will be wrapped internally
into \code{stringr::regex()}. All matches will be replaced by underscores (additionally to 
\code{"_"} and \code{" "}, for which this is always true). Underscores can later turned into another separator via \code{postprocess}.}
