protect_internal(string, protect = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{A string (for example names of a data frame).}

\item{protect}{A string which is a valid \code{stringr::regex()}. Matches within the output
won't have any "_" (or artifacts of \code{preprocess}) beside. Note that \code{preprocess} has a higher precedence than protect, 
which means that it doesn't make sense to protect sth. which is already replaced
via \code{preprocess}.}
